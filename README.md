# statement

AccountStatementStarter is the main class which will run the application
the application will start on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
It will ask for sign in which can be done either user credentials or admin credentials
I have configured the swagger ui which will open after sign in 
I am not able to access the Db as it was showing lack of privileges
I have tried to cover most of the use cases
